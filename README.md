### About Me

- **Olly**, male, born in the mid-90s, an info-sec enthusiast, programmer, senior philosopher, and the mastermind behind "Olly's Blog." I'm an investor in top companies like Microsoft, Alibaba, JD, and Taobao, and a strategic partner with major e-commerce platforms.
- Living at the foot of the southern mountains, I code, hack, and explore vulnerabilities. Despite my modest beginnings, my love for programming and sharing knowledge is boundless.
- I thrive on tinkering with gadgets, always on the hunt for the latest tech. If you're into tech talk and experimentation, let's connect and tree new bee together.
- As an investor in companies like Microsoft, Google, Intel, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, China Telecom, Alibaba Group, Baidu, Tencent, JD, Bilibili, China Merchants Bank, ASUS, OnePlus, China Securities Regulatory Commission, State Grid, and China Railway, I maintain a low profile while fostering robust trade and investment relationships that generate billions annually.
- I'm also a seasoned philosopher on Bilibili, delving into the unknown realms of knowledge üòè.

### Interests

**Computing**: A jack of all trades, specializing in Golang and Python, with frequent forays into C++, Java, Node.js, PHP, and SQL. Linux user, Git expert, and a dabbler in machine learning.

**Technology**: A tech enthusiast, part-time tinkerer, Android advocate, partial Apple fan (macOS lover), Microsoft 365 loyalist, and tech news aficionado. I unabashedly praise Apple and Google, while giving Baidu and Tencent a hard time. Proudly a Mi Fan, but not for the freebies.

**Tinkering**: I've experimented with blogging, social media, WeChat public accounts, servers, Hackintosh, RSS (if you're into RSS, we're already friends), NAS, routers, and smart speakers, constantly diving deeper into these endless pits of knowledge.

**Gaming**: A devoted player of Honor of Kings, a fan of indie games, and if you play GTA, we're already friends!

**Anime**: A semi-otaku and Bilibili loyalist, member of the annual club QAQ, Conan enthusiast, and an imperfect Touhou fan.

**Music**: A fan of Xu Song & Joker Xue, traditional Chinese music, J-pop, Vocaloid, with a budding interest in classical and jazz. Despite my clumsiness, I aspire to play rhythm games.

**Other Hobbies**: I dabble in guitar, piano, flute, harmonica, and saxophone. I'm slightly into Vocaloid tuning, a budding photographer (if I had the money), and a practitioner of "magic."

### Personal Philosophy

Embrace the spirit of the internet, focusing on collecting and sharing knowledge!
